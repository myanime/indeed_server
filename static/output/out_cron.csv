Other activities include developing an effective on-boarding and welcome process for new customers, developing cross sell and upsell programs that address customer needs and enable our customers to live out their best life at home.

If you thrive in a fast-paced sales environment and are looking for a long-term career then apply now.
We hire people who see opportunities; who back themselves and want to get ahead — and who won't stop until they do.
Sales experience and formal qualifications are a plus — but not mandatory to your success. What is essential is a commitment to your targets and a willingness to continually learn and increase your skills and abilities.
When you join our team as a Sales Consultant, you'll become part of a dynamic work culture that fosters competition and achievement. You'll focus on building great relationships with customers — whether in person or the phone, and for interactions lasting just a few minutes up to years of service. You'll assess customer needs, recommend products and services to suit, and upsell relevant add-ons to enhance customers' experiences and hit your targets. And you'll be doing all of this at our hugely profitable and busy stores (Bondi Junction).Most importantly, you'll be looking for a career, not a job, and be eager to show your leadership abilities and climb (or ride) to the top.
You're after a career in which you can make your mark, increase your skills, hit targets and strive for new ones and establish yourself as a professional in your field. You believe in yourself, and demonstrate enthusiasm and energy in all that you take on. Most of all, you like to see results.
If you had to describe yourself in one word, it would be 'competitive'. Your second would be a three-way tie between 'motivated', 'persistent' and 'driven'.

With the backing of part-owner Flight Centre Ltd, 99 Bikes have grown to operate 20 successful stores across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and have many more in the works. This partnership also provides 99 Bikes with world-class support across all areas of business, as well as on-going career opportunities for high achievers.
We are the largest single retailer of bikes in Australia, part of the highly successful Flight Centre group. We have opened 20 bike stores in 7 years and our goal is to have 70 stores by 2020.  Unlike other bike stores, we carry over 10 different brands of bikes and own our own wholesaler, which means we always have bikes in stock, at competitive prices. We also have a customer loyalty system with over 120,000 paid members and we support cycling-specific charities – for instance, in 2014 we donated 355 bikes to Ugandan children.

VACCA was successful in its bid for 3 year funding and following  negotiations with government it was decided to retain Link-Up Victoria  but expand its service so that it was able to support all Stolen  Generations, that is any adult Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander who  was removed, adopted, fostered or placed in an institution or any person  looking for family or loved ones who were removed or fostered, adopted  or placed in an institution.
The  Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency is recognised within the state  of Victoria as the lead agency in the provision of Aboriginal child and  family welfare services.

ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP:

We know first hand just how much you can learn working in a startup and adding lots of real tangible projects to your portfolio and we want to share that opportunity with one lucky grpahic design intern.


We're a startup that runs coding retreats in Bali -- think coding bootcamp + all-inclusive retreat + adventure tour mashed together and that's basically what we do. We take students, entrepreneurs and creatives away from the stress of daily life, pop them down together in a luxury pool villa, keep them nimble and relaxed with an in-house yoga instructor and keep their stomachs happy with an in-house chef. Then we teach them in-demand digital skills to help them accelerate their careers. After a big day of coding, we head out to go paddle-boarding,  surfing,  parasailing, banana-boating, or just sipping cocktails and watching the sunset. Then we wake up and do it all again. It's a hard life.
A LITTLE ABOUT US...

We're looking for someone with a work-hard play-hard mentality who wants to jump start their design career with by gaining practical work experience and building valuable connections.

This is not your typical internship.

Thanks to your Angel funding, winemakers like Jen Pfeiffer had the extra time and money they needed to make Top Shelf wines - selecting the very best fruit from immaculate vineyards and giving them an extra sprinkle of Angel-love at every step of the winemaking process. These wines are special!
In our humble opinion (and there are many who would disagree) Top Shelf wines are not NECESSARILY:

Please email your application including CV and cover letter to our New Business Directorclaire.mcshane@nakedwines.com.au.
Success in this role is based on the ability to generate leads, secure and foster long term, mutually beneficial partnerships that deliver customer growth for Naked Wines.
Soooo, that means you need to play nicely with others, be an outgoing relationship builder and be driven to hit targets set by the business.
You will also be responsible for contributing and executing the digital strategy across a number of our key digital channels, specifically retargeting and lead generation.
At Naked Wines, forming partnerships with like-minded businesses is key to spreading the Naked word and ultimately growing our business. Reporting to our New Business Director, you will be responsible for landing new partnerships and nurturing a handful of existing partners that will bring in new Naked Wines customers.
We're looking for a disciplined, analytical person to hit the ground running and own the execution of 
our operations department.
Our waterfront offices are located in Newport on Sydney's northern beaches, approximately 60 min by car north of Sydney's CBD which means a lunchtime swim or surf is always on the cards.
Here's your opportunity to work at one of Australia's most innovative startups.
Launched in Australia in 2012 after a successful five years in the UK, Naked Wines Angels have already invested over $40m in Australian winemakers.
Winemakers and Angels are directly connected on our website, sharing their views, ratings and suggestions with each other. Think of it as a dating agency for winemakers and wine drinkers!
Our customers, called Angels, crowdfund independent winemakers to make them exclusive, delicious wines in exchange for preferential prices.
What's more, when you give a talented winemaker the funds they need and then make them accountable for how the wine tastes to the people that funded them... the results are incredible.
It turns out that the very best wines are made with love and passion by a real winemaker, and not by a supermarket salesman.
Quite a claim, huh? Here's why we think it's true...
Naked Wines sells the best wine you've ever tasted.

This is a superb opportunity, in a great city, to lead one of Australia’s most highly regarded golf club organisations through the next stage of its development.
We welcome interest from proven golf club Chief Executive/General Management professionals in Australia and offshore. Ideally this experience will have been gained within other golf club membership based organisations of a similar scale, operational intensity (circa 40,000 rounds pa) and standing of The Australian Golf Club. You will be able to demonstrate a successful track record in strategic and operational leadership and financial management. You will also have the presence, communication and interpersonal skills, judgement and adaptability to drive the organisation through the continuous improvement in service standards and member experience. Very much a golfers’ club, a background, knowledge, capability and passion for golf is a given. Given the frequency of tournaments being hosted at the club, a depth of experience in a similar environment would serve you well. Tertiary qualifications in a relevant discipline would also be expected.
With a strong membership and forward thinking Board, this role becomes available at a very attractive time in the Club’s development. Reporting to the Board of Directors, you will have overall operations management responsibility. You will work with the Board in developing and implementing strategic and operational plans.
In 2012 the Club undertook a $5m course upgrade under the guidance of Jack Nicklaus, with 18 new greens being built and other aspects of the course being modernized. A $1.8m landscape plan was implemented at the same time to improve shot values and strategy, enhance aesthetics and improve maintenance efficiencies.
The Australian Golf Club has hosted 19 Australian Opens including back to back Australian Opens in 2014 and 2015. It is scheduled to host in 2017 and again in 2019, 2021 and 2023. The 2014 event showcased the talents of Jordan Spieth, who won the title that year, before going on to add the 2015 US Masters and US Open to his resume.
